### HI, I'm Fikri
#### Tech-savvy civil servant.

I love the world of web development, machine learning, data engineering, and system design.
Sometimes I do stuff with next.js, then jump to jupyter notebook, or cloud service. 
but most of the time I help my partners in my workplace with my IT skills and all tools that I know.
